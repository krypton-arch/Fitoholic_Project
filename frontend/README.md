### Setup & Installation

**1. Clone the Repository (or Copy the Folder)**

**2. Backend Setup (Spring Boot)**
- **Open the backend project** in your code editor at `Fitoholic/backend/api/`.
- **Create the Database:**
    - Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Command-Line Client or Workbench).
    - Run the following command to create the database:
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE fitoholic_db;
      ```
- **Configure Application Properties:**
    - Navigate to `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    - Update the following fields with your local credentials:
      ```properties
      # MySQL Database
      spring.datasource.password=[Your MySQL root password]

      # Razorpay API Keys (from your Razorpay Test Dashboard)
      razorpay.key.id=[Your Razorpay Key ID]
      razorpay.key.secret=[Your Razorpay Key Secret]
